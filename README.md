Wellcome to my new tool

Compatible with Windows and Linux

the offseckudo is a port scanning tool that locates a custom range of ports.

offseckudo is also a tool that sniffs the network cards you select and the custom protocols.

Run your code in your platform (run as sudo).

1- make a port scan

2- make an sniffer

3- available soon

4- exit

if you type 1(scan), the program will ask you an target ip- example: 192.168.20.15

next step is to inform the ports:

1- best ports in range 20-7071

2- best 4 ports(21,22,80,443)

3- all ports in range 1-65535(be careful when running this option, you can be blocked by target)

and the program will return to you the open ports.

if you typed 2(sniff), the program will ask you an network cards- example: eth0.

The next step is inform the protocol that you want- example: TCP, ICMP.
