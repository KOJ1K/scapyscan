Wellcome to my new tool

Compatible with Windows and Linux

the offseckudo is a port scanning tool that locates a custom range of ports.

offseckudo is also a tool that sniffs the network cards you select and the custom protocols.

1- make a port scan

2- make an sniffer

3- available soon

4- exit

if you type 1(scan), the program will ask you an target ip- example: 192.168.20.15

next step is to inform the ports:

1- best ports in range 20-7071

2- best 4 ports(21,22,80,443)

3- all ports in range 1-65535(be careful when running this option, you can be blocked by target)

and the program will return to you the open ports.
